# 2 Tree Types
- Binary Search Tree
- RedBlack Tree
- Splay Tree

# 3 Keys Beinginserted
n1 is of size One Million
n2 is of size Ten Million

Keys being inserted are generated by filling a vector of respective size n1 or n2 with a random number between 0 and n1/n2 - 1

# 4 Short Explanatino of what question is being asked

# 5 Table of times obtained by program

# 6 Short Statement of observqations

# 7 Short statement of any inferences from data
